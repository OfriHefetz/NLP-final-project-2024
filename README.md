# **Introduction**

Auctions represent a fascinating domain where economic theory and strategic decision-making converge. Among various auction types, the second-price auction holds a unique position due to its distinctive rules and implications for forbidding behavior. In a second-price auction, each bidder submits a bid without knowing the othersâ€™ bids; the highest bidder wins, but crucially, they pay the amount of the second-highest bid. This mechanism theoretically simplifies the bidding strategy: Participants should bid their true valuation of the item, as overbidding does not increase the chance of winning but can result in an overpayment, and underbidding risks losing the auction despite a willingness to pay more than the winning price. The intersection of game theory and NLP allows us to explore whether language models can simulate rational agents in such settings.

## Project Overview

This project proposes to examine how state-of-the-art language models perform in a simulated second-price auction environment. Specifically, it aims to investigate whether these models can exhibit rational bidding behavior consistent with economic theory and understand the decision-making process through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.

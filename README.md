**Introduction**
Auctions represent a fascinating domain where economic theory and strategic
decision-making converge. Among various auction types, the second-price auc-
tion holds a unique position due to its distinctive rules and implications for
bidder behavior. In a second-price auction, each bidder submits a bid with-
out knowing the others’ bids; the highest bidder wins, but crucially, they pay
the amount of the second-highest bid. This mechanism theoretically simplifies
the bidding strategy: Participants should bid their true valuation of the item,
as overbidding does not increase the chance of winning but can result in an
overpayment, and underbidding risks losing the auction despite a willingness to
pay more than the winning price. The intersection of game theory and NLP
allows us to explore whether language models can simulate rational agents in
such settings. **This project proposes to examine how state-of-the-art language
models perform in a simulated second-price auction environment. Specifically, it
aims to investigate whether these models can exhibit rational bidding behavior
consistent with economic theory and understand the decision-making process
through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.**
